# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
*This project focuses on predicting heart diseases through the application of various Machine Learning algorithms. Employing a systematic research approach, we aimed to leverage the predictive power of these algorithms while addressing specific research questions and objectives. Our methodology encompassed several key components:*

## Data Collection
Our research relied on a comprehensive dataset containing information pertinent to heart disease patients. This dataset served as the foundational source for training and evaluating our Machine Learning models. It included variables encompassing clinical parameters, genetic data, and lifestyle factors relevant to heart disease prediction.

## Choice of Machine Learning Algorithms
To thoroughly explore predictive capabilities, we selected a diverse set of Machine Learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. This approach allowed us to assess the performance of different algorithms and determine which ones offered the most accurate predictions for heart disease presence.

## Data Preprocessing
Prior to training the Machine Learning models, rigorous data preprocessing was conducted to ensure dataset quality and reliability. This involved handling missing values, scaling numerical features, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets to facilitate model evaluation.

## Model Training and Evaluation
Each selected Machine Learning algorithm was trained on the training dataset using appropriate hyperparameters. Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) to assess predictive accuracy and generalization capabilities.

*In conclusion, our methodology encompassed data collection, preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation, with a focus on interpretability and addressing potential limitations. This approach allowed for a comprehensive exploration of Machine Learning algorithms' predictive capabilities in heart disease prediction. However, it's essential to acknowledge inherent limitations and potential biases associated with our methodology, which could impact the generalizability of our findings to broader healthcare contexts.*
